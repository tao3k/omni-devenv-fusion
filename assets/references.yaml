# Omni-Dev-Fusion References Configuration
#
# Centralized path references for knowledge base and documentation.
# Used by Librarian for knowledge ingestion and by other modules for path resolution.
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep paths synchronized with actual directory structure.

# Knowledge Directories (for Librarian Ingestion)
#
# NOTE: These directories are scanned for knowledge files.
# Hidden directories (starting with '.') are ignored by default.
# LLM can decide via prompt which files should be skipped.
