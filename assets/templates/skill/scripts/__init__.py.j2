"""
{{ skill_name }}/scripts/ - Isolated implementation module

This package contains atomic script implementations for the {{ skill_name }} skill.
Each script is isolated via relative imports, preventing namespace conflicts
with other skills (e.g., docker/scripts/status.py).

Architecture:
    tools.py  -> Router (just dispatches)
    scripts/  -> Controllers (actual implementation)

Usage in tools.py:
    from .scripts import my_command
"""

# Import all implementations for direct access
from . import example

__all__ = [
    "example",
]
