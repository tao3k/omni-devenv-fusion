As an LLM, you must make an independent judgment on these files:

1. **Read the file content** - Verify what's actually staged
2. **Assess risk level**:
   - ✅ Safe: Templates, placeholders, documentation
   - ⚠️ Unsafe: Actual secrets, API keys, credentials, tokens
3. **Provide your assessment**:
   - "✅ Safe to commit: template with placeholder values"
   - "⚠️ Unsafe: contains actual secrets - recommend unstaging"
4. **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding

Your response should include:
- Which files you reviewed
- Your safety assessment for each
- Clear recommendation (commit or unstage)
