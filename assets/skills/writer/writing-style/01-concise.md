# Concise Writing Guidelines

## Core Principle: Concrete First, Strip Clutter

### Rules

1. **Use active voice**: "We deployed X" not "X was deployed by us"
2. **Cut empty words**: Remove "actually", "basically", "literally", "in order to"
3. **Short sentences**: Under 25 words average
4. **Code > Prose**: Use code blocks, tables, lists over paragraphs
5. **No hedging**: "Try to" → "Do"; "Might" → "Will"

### Examples
