# Advanced Tools (Find & Search) Skill

You have loaded the **Advanced Tools (Find & Search) Skill**.

## The Search Engine of Agentic OS

This skill is the **PRIMARY** gateway for locating anything in the project. It wraps high-performance Rust tools.

| Category     | Tool            | Implementation  | Best For                      |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Locator**  | `smart_find`    | **fd-find**     | Finding FILES by name/path    |
| **Searcher** | `smart_search`  | **ripgrep**     | Finding TEXT inside files     |
| **Refactor** | `batch_replace` | **Rust/Python** | Multi-file search and replace |

## Available Tools

### smart_find: Fast File Location

**ALWAYS use this to find files.** Superior to `ls` or `list_directory` for discovery.

```python
def smart_find(
    pattern: str = ".",      # Regex or glob for filename
    extension: str = None,   # Filter: 'py', 'rs', 'md'
    exclude: str = None,     # Patterns to ignore
    search_mode: str = "filename" # "filename" (fd) or "content" (rg -l)
) -> dict
```

### smart_search: Fast Code Search

**ALWAYS use this to find code content.** The gold standard for `grep`.

```python
def smart_search(
    pattern: str,            # Text or regex to find (REQUIRED)
    file_globs: str = None,  # Filter: "*.py *.ts"
    case_sensitive: bool = True,
    context_lines: int = 0
) -> dict
```

### batch_replace: Safe Refactoring

**RECOMMENDED for mass changes.** Always includes a dry-run preview.

```python
def batch_replace(
    pattern: str,            # Find this
    replacement: str,        # Replace with this
    file_glob: str = "**/*",
    dry_run: bool = True     # Default is PREVIEW for safety
) -> dict
```

## Use Cases & Intention

- **"Find all python files"** -> `smart_find(extension="py")`
- **"Where is the Kernel defined?"** -> `smart_search(pattern="class Kernel")`
- **"Find files containing API_KEY"** -> `smart_find(pattern="API_KEY", search_mode="content")`
- **"Rename variable 'old_name' to 'new_name'"** -> `batch_replace(...)`

## Important Rules

1. **Discovery First**: If you don't know where a file is, use `smart_find`.
2. **Context Matters**: Use `smart_search` with `context_lines` to understand match surroundings.
3. **Respect Ignored**: All tools automatically respect `.gitignore`.
4. **Prefer Patterns**: Use specific regex patterns to reduce noise.
