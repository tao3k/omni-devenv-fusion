dynamic_builder.py - Legacy Module (Deprecated)

This module is kept for potential future use but is no longer used.
The implementation has been moved to:
- builder.py: DynamicGraphBuilder core class
- compiled.py: CompiledGraph wrapper
- state_utils.py: State schema utilities with reducers

Import from the new modules directly:
    from agent.core.orchestrator.builder import DynamicGraphBuilder
    from agent.core.orchestrator.compiled import CompiledGraph
    from agent.core.orchestrator.state_utils import create_reducer_state_schema
