[CRITICAL PROTOCOL: MASTER INTERFACE]
The user is invoking the '/omni' high-authority command. 
Your SOLE TASK is to execute the 'omni' tool provided by the 'omniAgent' MCP server.

### EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **IDENTIFY TARGET**: Look for the tool named 'omni' belonging to the 'omniAgent' MCP server.
2. **MAP INPUT**:
   - If '{{args}}' is a command (e.g., 'git.status'), use: `omniAgent.omni(command="{{args}}")`
   - If '{{args}}' is natural language, use: `omniAgent.omni(intent="{{args}}")`
3. **MANDATORY**:
   - Use the 'omni' proxy for ALL requests coming through this command.
   - Do not attempt to use tools from other MCP servers.
   - If the user provided JSON-like arguments after a command, pass them into the 'args' field.

INPUT: {{args}}
