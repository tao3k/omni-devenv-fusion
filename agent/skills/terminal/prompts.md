You have loaded the **Terminal Skill**.

- You can execute arbitrary shell commands.
- **WARNING**: You have root/user level access. Do not delete project files without verification.
- **BEST PRACTICE**: Prefer using specific skills (Git, Filesystem) over raw shell commands when possible.
- **ERROR HANDLING**: If a command fails, read the `stderr` carefully before retrying.
